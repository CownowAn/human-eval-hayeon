The club is named after the Ave River, which flows through the town and into the Atlantic Ocean.\nFounded in 1939, they play their home matches at Est\u00e1dio do Rio Ave, also known as the Est\u00e1dio dos Arcos. Built in 1985, the current stadium seats approximately 12,815 people.\nThe club's home colours are green and white striped shirts. Meanwhile, the shorts and socks have historically alternated between green or white. Portuguese internationals Alfredo, Paulinho Santos, Quim, Rui Jorge and F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o started their careers at the club. Goalkeepers Jan Oblak and Ederson are some famous talents that were part of this side.\nThe \"Vilacondenses\"&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; best top-tier league finish was fifth in the 1981\u201382, 2017\u201318 and 2019\u201320 seasons. They reached the 1984 Ta\u00e7a de Portugal Final, where they lost to Porto 4\u20131, and the 2014 Ta\u00e7a de Portugal Final, where they lost to Benfica 1\u20130.

It is the most significant university of technology in the country and is considered the world's oldest institute of technology which has university rank and structure. It was founded in 1782.\nMore than 110 departments and institutes operate within the structure of eight faculties. About 1100 lecturers, 400 researchers and other degree holders and numerous invited lecturers and practising expert specialists participate in education and research at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Approximately 1381 of the university's 21,171 students are foreigners, coming from 50 countries. The Budapest University of Technology and Economics issues about 70% of Hungary's engineering degrees. 34 professors/researchers of the university are members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\nTraining courses are provided in five languages: Hungarian, English, German, French and Russian.\nThe ECTS credit system was introduced in 1995.

Although regarded as the first Romanian prime minister since 1945 who was not a communist or communist sympathiser, he was a socialist. He later self-identified as a liberal. He was also the president of the Senate from 1996 to 1999 and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1999 to 2000.\nHe was the leader of the Democratic Force (FD) party, which he founded after leaving the Democratic Party (PD) in 2003. He had previously served as an MP in the Lower Chamber, elected in 2012, elected as a member of the National Liberal Party. He had been removed from his seat in 2015 after being charged by the National Integrity Agency with incompatibility, but restored to office in 2016 after the Court of Appeals overturned the ruling.

In the early 2020 he joined Ilan Laufer's Social Liberal Platform, but he left it shortly afterwards. He joined the Social Democratic Party and was elected in the General Council of Bucharest in 2020, but he resigned shortly afterwards.\nIn 2022, Petre Roman emigrated to Switzerland, in order to become the president of the Swiss UMEF (university of applied sciences institute).\nTimestamp: 2025-08-09T11:27:32Z",
